    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team3)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    team4[3] = 'Babs';
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = ' Steven'
    console.log(team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age:12});
    console.log(cap2)
   console.log(person);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'Steven',

    console.log(dev);

    //object assign
    const dev2 = Object.assign({}, steven);

    //copies object
